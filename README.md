# US Accident Analysis
## Overview
This project conducts an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the US Accidents dataset. The analysis leverages advanced geographical analysis and visualization tools to uncover insights into accident patterns and their causes. By applying prompt engineering techniques with the Llama language model, the project generates impact scores and explanatory descriptions, enhancing the interpretability of feature engineering. The goal is to elucidate causal relationships between infrastructural discrepancies and accident occurrences, providing actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.
